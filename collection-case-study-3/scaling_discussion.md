### Data Partitioning:
* We can partition our input review data on date and restaurant. We can easily run our application on multiple machines.

### Google kubernetes Engine:
 * We can containerize and run our pipelines using docker. Each container can run an instance of the processing code, making it portable and scalable.
* Deploy the containers as pods in GKE. Kubernetes can manage the scaling of pods based on resource utilization and workload demands.
* Configure horizontal pod autoscaling to dynamically adjust the number of pods based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics. This ensures the application scales automatically in response to load changes.
